Test: instance such that

Assert that `"Abracadabra"` is an instance s of `String` such that
            `s.contains("")` is `true`
        and `s.substring(7)` is `"abra"`
        and `s.substring(7)` is an instance t of `String` such that
            `t.length()` is `4`.

Assert that `"Abracadabra"` is an instance s of `String` such that
            `s.toString()` is not `""`.

Assert that `@java.util.Collections@unmodifiableList(l)` is
            an instance u of `java.util.List` such that
                `u.size()` is `3`
            and `u.add(4)` throws an instance of `UnsupportedOperationException`
      where l = `{1, 2, 3}`.

Assert `1/0` throws an instance e of `ArithmeticException` such that
`e.initCause(e)` throws an instance e2 of `IllegalArgumentException` such that
`e2.setStackTrace(null)` throws an instance of `NullPointerException`.
