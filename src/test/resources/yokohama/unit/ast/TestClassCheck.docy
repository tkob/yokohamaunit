# Test: This test case contains invalid class reference

Assert that `1` is an instance of `com.example.NotFound3`.

Assert that `1` is an instance x of `com.example.NotFound4` such that `e.m()`
is `1`.

Assert that `1` is an instance of `NotFound1`.

Assert that `1` is an instance x of `NotFound2` such that `e.m()` is `1`.

Assert that `{}` is an instance of `java.util.List`.

Assert that `{}` is an instance x of `List` such that `e` is `1`.

# Test: Another test case

## Setup

Let s be a stub of `com.example.NotFound5` such that method
 `m(com.example.NotFound6)` returns `0`
and s be a stub of `NotFound1` such that method `m(NotFound2)` returns `0`
and s be a stub of `List` such that method `m(List)` returns `0`.

Let t be "string" as `com.example.NotFound9`.

## Verify

Assert that `1` is an instance of `com.example.NotFound7`.

Assert that `1` is an instance x of `com.example.NotFound8` such that `e.m()`
is `1`.

Assert that `1` is an instance of `NotFound1`.

Assert that `1` is an instance x of `NotFound2` such that `e.m()` is `1`.

Assert that `{}` is an instance of `java.util.List`.

Assert that `{}` is an instance x of `List` such that `e` is `1`.
