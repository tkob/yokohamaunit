*[NotFound1]: com.example.NotFound1
*[NotFound2]: com.example.NotFound2

# Test: This test case contains invalid class reference

Assert that `1` is an instance of `com.example.NotFound3`.
Assert that `1` is an instance x of `com.example.NotFound4` such that `e.m()`
is `1`.

# Test: Another test case

## Setup
Let s be a stub of `com.example.NotFound5` such that method
`m(com.example.NotFound6)` returns `0`.

## Verify
Assert that `1` is an instance of `com.example.NotFound7`.
Assert that `1` is an instance x of `com.example.NotFound8` such that `e.m()`
is `1`.
